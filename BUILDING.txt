[Building XFire]
Due to the many preferences of people regarding build systems,
we seem to have ended up with 3: Ant, Maven 1.x, and Maven 2.x.
Here is a quick lineup of what works and what doesn't with each 
build:

Maven 2.0.2+:
- Jars, bundled jar and distribution work correctly.

Ant:
- This build is the *least supported*, but will work most of the 
  time. However, not all modules currently have ant builds. Use
  at your own risk.
  
[Deploying Snapshots and Distributions]
This should install the xfire jars and distribution to the Maven 
1 and 2 repositories:
$ mvn -Duser.name=yourusername deploy
